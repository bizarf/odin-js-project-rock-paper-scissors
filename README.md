# The Odin Project - Project: Rock Paper Scissors
The goal of this project is to create a rock, paper, scissors game. This will be coded in Javascript. 

The first version of this project will just be the game coded and played with the developer tool's console. 

I will be adding a GUI later to allow the game to be played on the webpage.
